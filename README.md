## Results / Conclusion

```
1. The best Algorithm to use for this dataset is RandomForestRegressor
2. Untuned model was able to explain 90.65% of variance on test set 
3. Tuned model was able to explain 91.08% of varaince on test set which is increased by ~0.5
4. Feature reduction was not able to add to better R2 score
